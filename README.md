## Use MapClosures in your C++ project
    
1. Include the following snippet in your project's `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
set(USE_SYSTEM_EIGEN3 ON CACHE BOOL "use system eigen3")
set(USE_SYSTEM_TBB ON CACHE BOOL "use system tbb")
set(USE_SYSTEM_OPENCV ON CACHE BOOL "use system opencv")

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    map_closures 
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/PRBonn/MapClosures.git
        GIT_TAG main
        SOURCE_SUBDIR cpp
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(map_closures)

```
You can trigger the automatic installation of the dependencies by playing around with the options in the first three lines of the snippet.

2. Link **MapClosures** against your library or executable:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_target PUBLIC map_closures)
```
3. The following _include_ directive in your source code file will provide access to the core API of MapClosures:
```cpp
#include <map_closures/MapClosures.hpp>
```

## Install the Python API and CLI 
1. First, install the necessary system dependencies
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential cmake pybind11-dev libeigen3-dev libopencv-dev libtbb-dev
    ```
2. To get an odometry estimate in our Python CLI we rely on [KISS-ICP](https://github.com/PRBonn/kiss-icp), you can install it using
    ```sh
    pip install kiss-icp
    ```
3. Then run:  
    ```sh
    make
    ```
### Usage

## Citation

If you use this library for any academic work, please cite our original [paper](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/pdfs/gupta2024icra.pdf).

```bibtex
@inproceedings{gupta2024icra,
    author     = {S. Gupta and T. Guadagnino and B. Mersch and I. Vizzo and C. Stachniss},
    title      = {{Effectively Detecting Loop Closures using Point Cloud Density Maps}},
    booktitle  = {IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)},
    year       = {2024},
    codeurl    = {https://github.com/PRBonn/MapClosures},
}
```
### Paper Results
As we decided to continue the development of **MapClosures** beyond the scope of the ICRA paper, we created a ``git tag`` so that researchers can consistently reproduce the results of the publication. To checkout at this tag, you can run the following:
```sh
git checkout ICRA2024
```
Our development aims to push the performances of **MapClosures** above the original results of the paper.

**Note**: You can download the ground-truth loop closure candidates for the datasets used in the paper from [here](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/html/projects/gupta2024icra/MapClosuresGroundtruth.zip). When run with `-e` flag, our pipeline will search for groundtruth data under the folder at path `<data>/loop_closure/`. If not found, it will first generate the groundtruth closures which might consume some time.
