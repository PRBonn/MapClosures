## Install

### Dependencies
- *Essentials*
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential cmake pybind11-dev python3-dev python3-pip
    ```

- *Optionally Built* \
  In this case you have two options:
  - **Option 1**: You can install them by the package manager in your operative system, e.g. in Ubuntu 22.04:
      ```sh
      sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev libopencv-dev libtbb-dev
      ```
      this will of course make the build of **MapClosures** much faster.
  - **Option 2**: Let the build system handle them:
      ```sh
      cmake -B build -S cpp -DUSE_SYSTEM_TBB=OFF -DUSE_SYSTEM_OPENCV=OFF -DUSE_SYSTEM_EIGEN3=OFF
      ```
      this will be slower in terms of build time, but will enable you to have a different version of this libraries installed in your system without interfering with the build of **MapClosures**.

Once the dependencies are installed, the C++ library can be build by using standard cmake commands:
```sh
cmake -B build -S cpp
cmake --build build -j8
```

## Python Package
We provide a _python_ wrapper for **MapClosures** which can be easily installed by simply running:
```sh
make
```
### Usage
<details>
<summary>
The following command will provide details about how to use our pipeline:

```sh
map_closure_pipeline --help
```

## Citation

If you use this library for any academic work, please cite our original [paper](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/pdfs/gupta2024icra.pdf).

```bibtex
@inproceedings{gupta2024icra,

    title      = {{Effectively Detecting Loop Closures using Point Cloud Density Maps}},
    booktitle  = {IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)},

```
### Paper Results
As we decided to continue the development of **MapClosures** beyond the scope of the ICRA paper, we created a ``git tag`` so that researchers can consistently reproduce the results of the publication. To checkout at this tag, you can run the following:
```sh
git checkout ICRA2024
```
Our development aims to push the performances of **MapClosures** above the original results of the paper.

**Note**: You can download the ground-truth loop closure candidates for the datasets used in the paper from [here](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/html/projects/gupta2024icra/MapClosuresGroundtruth.zip). When run with `-e` flag, our pipeline will search for groundtruth data under the folder at path `<data>/loop_closure/`. If not found, it will first generate the groundtruth closures which might consume some time.
